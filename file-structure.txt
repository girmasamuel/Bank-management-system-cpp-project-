Explanation of the Structure:

• include/: Contains all header files (.h) defining interfaces and declarations.
    * data_structures/:  Houses the core data structures used in the system.
        * Account.h, Customer.h, Transaction.h: Define classes representing accounts, customers, and transactions.
        * BinarySearchTree.h, LinkedList.h:  Implement specific data structures, chosen based on the system's needs. 
    * algorithms/:  Holds implementations of algorithms used for sorting, searching, and other operations.
    * utils/: Contains utility functions for input validation, file I/O, and other helper functions.
    * BankSystem.h: Defines the main Bank System class, which manages the overall functionality.

• src/: Contains the source code files (.cpp) implementing the logic.
    * Structure mirrors include/:  Each header file has a corresponding .cpp file for implementation.
    * main.cpp: The entry point of the program, where the Bank System is initialized and the main loop runs.

• resources/: Stores any external resources, such as data files or configuration files.

• tests/:  Contains unit tests for the data structures and algorithms, ensuring their correctness.

• CMakeLists.txt:  A CMake file for building the project.

• README.md:  Provides information about the project, instructions, and usage.


Advanced Aspects:

• Modular Design: The project is divided into logical modules (data structures, algorithms, utils) for better organization and maintainability.

• Data Structures:  The use of Binary Search Trees for account management allows for efficient searching and sorting of accounts based on account number or other criteria. Linked Lists can be used to store transaction history for each account.

• Algorithms: Implementing sorting and searching algorithms allows for optimized operations within the system.

• Abstraction:  Classes like Account, Customer, and Transaction encapsulate data and functionality, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

• Testing:  The tests/ folder encourages writing unit tests for the core components, ensuring the correctness and reliability of the system.


Note:

• This is a general structure. You can adapt it based on the specific requirements of your project.
• You might need to add more data structures and algorithms depending on the features you want to implement (e.g., graph data structures for network analysis, hashing for faster account lookups).
• Consider using design patterns like Singleton for managing the Bank System instance, and Factory patterns for creating different account types.
